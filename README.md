# `Busra's Dashboard`

Busra's Dashboard is a full stack project which is combined of a backend and frontend apps. In the app, you can : 

- Display daily currencies
- Checkout the COVID-19 data of the world, each country, and each USA states
- Keep a journal of your blessings

## `Motivation`

My motivation for doing this project is both to learn more about React, and to make a project that is useful for many people. Since we are going through hard times as a whole world due to the pandemic, I thought sharing Coronavirus data would be beneficial to many people. 
Currency section of the app is also useful for many people as it displays the recent currency rates. 
My motivation for the gratitude journal is to make people realize how many blessings they have in their lives. According to studies, keeping a gratitude journal would make people happier compare to ones who do not. I wanted to impact people's lives while learning about react.
