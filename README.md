# `Busra's Dashboard`

Busra's Dashboard is a full stack project which is combined of a backend and frontend projects. In the app, yo can : 
-Display daily currencies
-Checkout the COVID-19 data of the world, each country, and each USA states
- Keep a journal of your blessings

## `Motivation`

My motivation to do this project is both learn more about React, and make a project that is useful for many people. Since we are going through hard times as a whole world, I thought sharing Coronavirus data would be beneficial to many people. Currency section of the app is also useful for many people as it displays the recent currency rates. 
My motivation for the gratitude journal is to make people realize how many  blessings they have. According to studies, keeping a gratitude journal would make people happier compare to ones who do not.
